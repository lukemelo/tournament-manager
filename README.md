# tournament-manager
A comprehensive tournament management application built with PyQt5. Seamlessly handles team registration, round-robin matchups, point tabulation, and elimination bracket seeding to determine the champion.

Description
This application is designed to manage and track the progress of tournaments using a combination of round robin and elimination brackets.

Workflow
1. Team Registration:
Teams are registered into the system, and their details are recorded.
This registration phase sets the stage for the tournament, allowing organizers to understand the number of participants and plan subsequent phases.
2. Generate Round Robins:
What is a Round Robin?

A round robin tournament is a competition where each team plays against every other team exactly once.
It ensures that each team has an equal opportunity against all other participants, offering a comprehensive method to seed teams into the subsequent elimination bracket.
Once teams are registered, the system generates matchups for the round robin phase.

Teams are awarded points based on their performance in each match.

3. Tabulate Round Robin Results:
At the end of the round robin phase, teams are ranked based on their accumulated points.
This ranking or tabulation helps in understanding the performance of each team and is crucial for the seeding process in the elimination brackets.
4. Elimination Bracket:
What is an Elimination Bracket?

The elimination bracket pits teams against each other in pairs. The loser of each matchup is eliminated from the tournament, while the winner progresses to the next round.
This continues until only one team remains, which is then crowned the champion.
Seeding:

Seeding is the method used to distribute teams in the elimination bracket.
In this application, seeding is determined by the results of the round robin phase. The better a team's performance in the round robin phase, the higher their seed will be in the elimination bracket.
A unique seeding mechanism ensures that matchups are created in a way that rewards teams for their performance in the round robin phase. This means that higher-ranked teams are paired against lower-ranked teams in the early rounds.
Consolation Match:

A feature of this application is the consolation match, which is held among the teams eliminated in the semi-finals. The winner of this match secures the third-place position in the tournament.
